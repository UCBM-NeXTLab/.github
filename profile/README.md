# NeXT Lab – GitHub Organisation  
**Neuroscience × Neuroengineering × Human-Technology Interaction**

## Overview  
The **NeXT Lab** (Neurophysiology and Neuroengineering of Human-Technology Interaction) at **Università Campus Bio-Medico di Roma** investigates the neurophysiological processes underlying complex interactions between the human nervous system and technological artefacts.  

Our mission is to advance neuroscience and neuroengineering, bridging experimental neurophysiology, robotics, virtual/augmented reality, signal processing, and human-machine interfaces to create novel assistive, rehabilitative, and augmentative technologies.
