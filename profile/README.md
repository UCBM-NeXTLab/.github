# NextLab Rome

Welcome to the **NextLab Rome** GitHub Organization — a multidisciplinary research collective based at the **University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome**, focusing on the intersection of **Neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence, and Robotics**.  
Our mission is to explore how technology can model, understand, and extend human cognition and behavior through innovative computational approaches.

## 🧠 About Us

NextLab (Neuroscience and Experimental Technologies Laboratory) investigates the neural and physiological bases of perception, embodiment, and human–machine interaction.  
We combine experimental research, advanced signal processing, and deep learning to bridge the gap between neuroscience and engineering.

Our research spans:
- **Human–Robot Interaction (HRI)**
- **Autonomic Nervous System modeling**
- **Embodied Artificial Intelligence**
- **Computational Neuroscience**
- **Physiological Signal Processing**
- **Affective Computing**

We believe in open, reproducible, and ethically grounded science — and our GitHub repositories reflect that.
